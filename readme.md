One thing I've learned as a newcomer to the programmer's world is that, if you really want to be a great software engineer, a solid understanding of different algorithms and data structures is a must. Thus LeetCode **medium to hard** level code challenge is sometime required by employers.

But, there're over 1500 challenges on LeetCode, where should I get start with? what should I focus on?

So I started browsing over GitHub trying to find some LeetCode notes, categorize different kind of challenges to help me. Then I found this awesome one.

The author picked up around 200 classic LeetCode challenges, categorized them, and explained some of the solution in detail.

Thanks to the original author for his great work.

But it is written in Simplified Chinese, so my work here is to translate it over to English, and solve the challenge and tested with Javascript, explain the my thought process vs the author's and explain the solution in detailed steps.

Solutions in Python code will also be provided, but due to the limitation of my time, no Python tester was provided.

Now, let's get started, solve the challenge, learn and expend our knowledge in computer science.

My solution won't be the best solution, so if you have a better idea, please reach out to me.

**Note: Do not rush to submit your solution to LeetCode, just to test out whether it works or not. If it doesn't, it count against your over all submit/passing ratio. Is it bad? I don't know. But I don't like to see my raito being lowered.**
